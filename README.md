# macos-cpu-throttle-notifier

Get notifications when your CPU gets throttled.

Run the app to get a item in your menu tray. It will notify you when
your cpu is throttled and when it is back to 100%.

## Note

I am an Android developer, and just whipped this up from code snippets
I found on stack overflow. It seems to do what I want but willing to
accept code cleanup from people who know swift and macOS development.
