# macos-cpu-throttle-notifier

Get notifications when your CPU gets throttled.

Run the app to get a item in your menu tray. It will notify you when
your cpu is throttled and when it is back to 100%.

## Why

I noticed my computer seemed to run faster when I had a box fan next too it.
Now I know when I need to have that box fan running and if I need to turn it
up to a hire speed.

## Note

I am an Android developer, and just whipped this up from code snippets
I found on stack overflow. It seems to do what I want but if you want to 
help me out and make the code nicer that would be awesome.
